This site contains some laboratory projects of real-time embbeded systems using Ada and some commercial ARM-based microcontrollers.

## Real-Time Embedded systems

**Real-time systems** are computer systems that carry out some actions in specified time intervals. The most common forms of real-time specifications are:

* Execution patterns
   * _Periodic actions_, which are required to be executed at regular time intervals.
   * _Sporadic actions_, which are required to be executed whenever a given event occurs.
* Deadlines
   * A _deadline_ specification marks the time by which an action must be completed.
   relative to the time when the action is released for execution.

**Embedded systems** are computer systems that perform information processing or control functions within a larger engineering system. Many embedded systems have real-time constraints.
